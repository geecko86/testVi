Nowadays, AI is more powerful than ever. It's also democratized and touching all domains. 
With power comes great responsibilities. 
Concerns about AI range from bias to hallucination and everyne in society is concerned by this new revolution. 

This repo is an attemps to create an ethical oath for technology developers.
Derived from the Hippocratic oath that doctors pledge when finishing their studies and dating from BC (exact date is 
debated and unknown). I've also been inspired by John Nosta and his AI-pocratic Oath. 

If you like the oath, pledge by following these steps: 

1. Fork & clone the repo
3. Add an empty commit 
```git commit --allow-empty -m "I pledge"```
4. Push & create a PR

The hippocratic oath has evolved a lot over the centuries so feel free to send me your suggestions for updates to the 
oath and I'll make sure to submit them to a vote.
